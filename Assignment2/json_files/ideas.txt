First task: Encrypt with given parameters and add to jso file --> SWHE scheme
    --> c = pq + 2r + m, where r <-- [0, 2^(rho)] < p/2

Second Taks:
    --> run operations and then check if the decrypted ciphertext is 1
    --> probably with 5 bits faster since the noise gets too big faster??

Third Task:
    --> 



Fuctions to implement_
    SWHE:
        - Encrypt
        - Decrpt
        - XOR
